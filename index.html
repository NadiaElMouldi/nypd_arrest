        <h1 style="color:black;font-size:50px;">New York City Arrest Data: Analysis by Demographics</h1>
        <h2 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Introduction</h2>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">In the last couple of weeks, as New York City is implementing lockdow rules on New Yorkers in order
          to face the corona virus crisis that has deeply affected the city, news outlets and social media highlighted
          a series of arrests made by the New York Police Department against people who were not respecting the social
          distancing that the city is trying to enforce. However, these arrests seemed to target black people specifically 
          rather than white New Yorkers. In fact, two side-by-side photos were circulating: one of NYPD officers distributing masks
          and gently talking to white New Yorkers in a West Village park where social distancing rules were clearly not
          respected, the other of NYPD officers using force and beating black New Yorkers in Queens for not abiding
          by social distancing rules. This is an issue that is not necessarily specific to the COVID-19 situation. For this reason,
          I wanted to examine arrests done by the NYPD during 2020 and analyse these arrests by demographics. I am hoping these visualisations
          will make the racial disparity in police arrest clearer and tangible.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Data</h2>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">I obtained the data from the NYC Open Data website. The dataset
          contains every arrest that was effectuated by the New York City Police Department during 2020. Each record
          has information like the time of the arrest and the type of crime, as well as the demographic information of
          the suspect. According to NYC Open Data, "this data is manually extracted every quarter 
          and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning."

        Each point on the map represents an arrest effectuated by the New York Police Department since January 1st 2020. The color of the point represents
        the race description as classified in the time of arrest. From a visual perspective, arrests of black people seem to be the most common
        among all other races (21,170), followed by hispanics (~15000), then white people (5022).
        However, what is striking is that Black people in no way represent the majority of the New York City population. In fact,
        white people constitute the majority of the NYC population, followed by Hispanics, then Black people. I want to examine
        how this racial disparity in arrests presents itself within different categories of arrests, mainly social distancing related arrests.

        <br>
        <br>

        Given that the data for covid-related social distancing arrests is not clearly available in this data source, I decided
        to choose a category of arrest to examine the racial disparity in law enforcement. The below graph shows arrests 
        related to Marijuana posession and sale, broken down by race of the suspect.
        </p>

        <div id=bars_m style="color:black;font-size:35px;">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">
         In the last 5 months, of the 4220 arrests related to marijuana, 45% involved black people, 40% involved hispanics. Keeping in mind that
         white people represent 45% of the total New York City population, their arrests in crimes related to marijuana only represent 11% of the total
         arrests. Although it is not possible (using this data) to analyse discrimination as the main driver for this racial disparity in arrests,
         the above numbers show a systematic structure in New York City that leads to higher numbers of arrests of black and hispanic New Yorkers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">
          According to a paper entitled "THE RACE/ETHNICITY DISPARITY IN MISDEMEANOR MARIJUANA ARRESTS IN NEW YORK CITY*" by Golub, Andrew et al. New York State’s Attorney General reported 
          that the “Stop-and-Frisk” program (in which civilians were temporarily detained, questioned, and sometimes searched) disproportionately affected NYC’s blacks and Hispanics.
          In their analysis of Marijuana in Public View arrests, most arrestees have been black or Hispanic which also ave been more likely to be detained prior to arraignment, 
          convicted, and sentenced to jail than their white counterparts.
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561263/">Access paper here.</a>
        </p>

        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">
          This racial disparity unfairly affects black and hispanic communities and should be addressed. In this project, I only looked
          at arrest data by race of the suspect. It would be as important to analyse the arrest data by the location of the arrest in order to 
          examine and compare disparities in arrests between New York City boroughs, which in itself can be linked back to race.
        </p>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:35px;">
          This leads to say that the fact that most arestees during this lockdown period are black and hispanic should not come as a surprise, as this is the case for most other
          categories of arrest.
          This is a pattern that has been occuring for years now and is usually not paid attention to by the public or the press because it does not always goes
          viral as part of a big social media campaign.
